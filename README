iOS only. 


Hello, you may have to quit and relaunch the app if it freezes. 


Notes about my implementation: 


HOMEPAGE
DetailsPage

CALENDAR
- built week logic
- implemented the UI/style attributes
- used a tutorial for the calendar dates logic (cited)


TYPE DETAILS
calling (trivial)
pictures (animated, standard hover over)
Categories and selection
FBIntegration
Rating (on static page but uiview is uibezier generated)




Recommended Features to Try:


Categories and Subcategories of tasks are uploaded via code, then cached, updated, and retrieved when needed. 
some caching of query calls from parse

"Call me later option"
Calendar scroll views: used Github for simple dates rendering
						implemented own logic for date selection, current week, current dates
						own graphics and UI

Implemented Picker
	- did transformation

feedback/voting: uibezier


appdel: animations and attr strings, styling with dicts ...


the following works for parse: but parse is down




Main features: fully functional + DB integration


Recommended tasks:
right now if you outsource, you increment all of them (i can't update parse manually when you grade)
