Hello, you may have to quit and relaunch the app if it freezes (weird issue with Parse). That aside, this was fun. I got carried away with the design component and wanted to focus on UI over a hodge-podge of features. Please look through the files to see the extent of my implementations. 

Thank you!


Recommended Flows:
- make a task and try all the detail inputs
- quit and relaunch to see the main page get updated (ideally this would be done by the admin)
- open your task and "outsource it"
***feel free to go into Parse and change the "progress", as an admin would, to see status updates***

Notes about my implementation: 

FB INTEGRATION
- Integrated FB API to enable logins

HOMEPAGE
- Using Parse to render/update everything. It is down at the moment, so I hope my update object functions work during testing.


TASK CATEGORIES/SUBCATEGORIES
- All data/logic is built on Parse (not hard coded)


CALENDAR DETAILS
	- built week, and date selection logic
	- implemented the UI/style attributes
	- used a tutorial for the calendar generating logic (cited)
	
	- TIME PICKER
		- transformations

OTHER DETAILS

	TYPE DETAILS
		- animations

	TAKING/UPLOAD PHOTOS
		- UIImagePicker
		- extra animations

	CALLING (trivial)


ASSISTANT RATING 
	- This page is static except for the stars, which are UIBezierPaths

CACHING
	- Some caching with task retrieval
	- Categories and Subcategories of tasks are uploaded via code, then cached, updated, and retrieved when needed. 


AppDelegate
	- AttrStrings
	- more animations
